# 15-Day-Python-Senior-DE-Sprint
15-day intensive sprint from basic to advanced Python for Data Engineering and AI

🎯 The Mission
To move beyond basic scripting and master the "Engineering" in Data Engineering. This sprint focuses on memory efficiency, scalable architecture, and the integration of AI tools (Vector DBs, LLMs) into data pipelines.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12+
- **Data:** Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy, PyArrow
- **AI/Vector:** Pinecone, FastAPI
- **Ops:** Pytest, Docker, GitHub Actions

📅 The Roadmap
- [ ] **Day 01:** Advanced Functions & Scope (args/kwargs, Closures)
- [ ] **Day 02:** Functional Tools (Decorators, Lambda, Map/Filter)
- [ ] **Day 03:** Memory Mastery (Generators & Iterators)
- [ ] **Day 04:** OOP I (Classes, Attributes, Methods)
- [ ] **Day 05:** OOP II (Inheritance, Dunder Methods, Context Managers)
- [ ] **Day 06:** Error Handling & Production Logging
- [ ] **Day 07:** File I/O (JSON, Parquet, Avro)
- [ ] **Day 08:** High-Performance Computing (NumPy Vectorization)
- [ ] **Day 09:** Pandas I (Efficiency & Large Datasets)
- [ ] **Day 10:** Pandas II & Data Validation (Pydantic)
- [ ] **Day 11:** Database Mastery (SQLAlchemy & ORM)
- [ ] **Day 12:** Speed & Concurrency (Threading vs. Multiprocessing)
- [ ] **Day 13:** Building APIs (FastAPI for AI Models)
- [ ] **Day 14:** AI Infrastructure (Vector DBs & RAG Pipelines)
- [ ] **Day 15:** Grand Capstone: Automated AI Data Pipeline
